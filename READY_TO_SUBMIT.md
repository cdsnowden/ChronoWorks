## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Don't overthink screenshots** - You can update them anytime after submission
2. **Use demo data only** - Never show real employee names/data
3. **Start with internal testing** - Don't go straight to production
4. **You only need 1 tester** - Can be your own email
5. **Privacy policy doesn't need to be fancy** - The HTML file is perfectly fine
