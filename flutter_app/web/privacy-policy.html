        <h1>ChronoWorks Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>ChronoWorks ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our employee time tracking application and related services (collectively, the "Service").</p>
            <p>Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the Service.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>2.1 Information You Provide to Us</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When your employer registers your company or you create an account, we collect your name, email address, phone number, job title, and password.</li>
                <li><strong>Company Information:</strong> Business name, address, industry, number of employees, and contact information.</li>
                <li><strong>Profile Information:</strong> Profile pictures, employee ID, department, and other information you choose to provide.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time Tracking Data:</strong> Clock in/out times, break times, shift schedules, time entries, and total hours worked.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> When you enable location services and your subscription plan includes GPS tracking, we collect precise geolocation data (latitude and longitude) when you clock in, clock out, start breaks, and end breaks. This helps verify that employees are at authorized work locations.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device type, operating system, unique device identifiers, IP address, and mobile network information.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the Service, including features used, pages viewed, and time spent in the app.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Important Note About Location Tracking:</strong> GPS location tracking is only available on Silver plan ($89.99/month) and higher. Location data is only collected when you actively clock in/out or start/end breaks. We do not track your location when you are not using the time clock feature. You must grant location permissions in your device settings for this feature to work. You can disable location permissions at any time, though this may affect certain features like geofencing.
